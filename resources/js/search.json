For example, playing a 1080p video on a 2160p monitor means that it has to be upscaled to fill the screen, otherwise it'd simply play in 1/4th of the screen. Upscaling is not a choice that you can enable or disable while in full screen, the only thing that can be changed is the method of scaling. Consequently, upscaling is not something you can use to \"enhance\" the video when playing back at the same resolution. It is not a way to somehow improve 1080p video playing on a 1080p display. The shaders activate only when the video resolution does not match the screen resolution and scaling is needed.","The default scaling on most players is bad. Mpv has a built in high quality profile called gpu-hq which enables better upscaling algorithms (scale=spline36, cscale=spline36, dscale=mitchell). This option is necessary even if you use external shaders to act as a fallback. Any scaling options explicitly specified after this will override it. For those with powerful gpus, even higher quality external shaders are available - FSRCNNX, NNEDI etc. The file has to be placed in %appdata%/mpv/shaders and the line glsl-shader=~~/FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1.glsl has to be added to the config. Press shift+I followed by 2 for confirmation that the shader is working. Dropped frames or high frame times (above 25ms) are a signal that your gpu isn't able to keep up and you should switch to a less demanding shader.","The shaders mentioned above are 2x scalers, which means that they always scale by 2x. For 720p to 1080p, the video will first be scaled to 1440p by FSRCNNX and then downscaled to 1080p by dscale=mitchell. For 720p to 2160p, FSRCNNX will do 720p to 1440p and then scale=spline36 will scale it the rest of the way to 2160p. When scaling below a certain threshold is required, FSRCNNX will not activate and mpv will fallback to spline36. There are also scalers like ravu-zoom can upscale to arbitrary ratios, at the cost of slow performance because of rendering to the target resolution directly.","Ravu and NNEDI - https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers FSRCNNX - https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases"]},{"l":"Filtering","p":["The same kind of filtering that is used by encoders but in real time. It's not an alternative to a good encode, but rather a temporary fix for web sources. Debanding is the most commonly used and the only one necessary. Detail enhancement, noise reduction, sharpening etc. are not recommended. All these options are available with both mpv and madvr.

However, displays often run at refresh rates that do not match this frame rate, leading to an effect known as judder. Judder is most commonly seen with laptops/desktops that have 60hz displays, because the refresh rate is not an integer multiple of the content frame rate. 60hz/24fps is 2.5, and since you can't refresh 2.5 times per frame, it has to be averaged out over time. In this case the first frame will be held for 2 refreshes, the second frame for 3 refreshes, the third for 2 and so on leading to the 2.5 average. Because of this, each frame is shown for a different amount of time (33.3ms for even frames, 50ms for odd) which leads to motion appearing stuttery/laggy, this is especially noticeable during panning scenes. While almost all anime is 24fps, you also may watch other content such as live action (sometimes 25fps) and YouTube (mostly 30/60fps, sometimes 25/50fps) and if you do, it's important to be able to play those frame rates back properly.","The solution: Matching the display refresh rate to the content frame rate, of which there are many methods","Adaptive sync: G-Sync/G-Sync Compatible (Certified)/Freesync Premium is by far the best solution, however requires the correct GPU and monitor to utilise. The display will perfectly match the content regardless of the frame rate. Normal Freesync may work, however only if the monitor supports LFC. Be sure to use a player that will activate adaptive sync, such as MPV.","Automatic Refresh Rate Adjustment: Many streaming devices (Apple TV, Shield, Fire stick etc) will have the ability to change a TVs refresh rate to match the content frame rate, either through the device settings itself or a setting in the playback software (Kodi, Plex etc). 24/30/60fps content should all work perfectly, however 25fps content requires 25/50hz support, which some TVs in NTSC regions may not support.","High refresh rate displays: 120hz, 144hz, 240hz, and 360hz are all multiples of 24, and as such will match perfectly since each frame can be repeated for multiple refreshes. However 144hz will not display 30/60fps content properly, and none of the above will handle 25fps content correctly."]},{"l":"Compatibility","p":["Decoding is the process of playing the video file. There are two types - hardware and software. Everything can be decoded, the difference is in the amount of work needed to do that. When it's hardware accelerated, it doesn't put any strain on your device cpu.","Most PC players will decode everything with swdecode as a fallback option. The problem is when this decoding isn't fast enough to play your video in real time. That won't ever be a problem is hwdecode is supported for that codec.","If you're watching on a TV/+Android box, you'll see a list of supported codecs in their specifications. Plex and other media servers will recognize a format as not supported and start transcoding to h264 8 bit. Kodi player is the better option it'll fallback to software decoding like on a PC, giving you the option to always direct stream or run without a server. However, since the cpu on your tv/box is much weaker compared to a PC, there will be instances of horrible lag when trying to force swdecode. Note that software decoding utilizes your cpu, so the cause of lag isn't limited to decoding. It's anything that might be using your cpu at the time. Like when there's a lot of complicated .ass typesetting which needs to be rendered, that will lag with a weak cpu no matter what the video codec is.

The codec is the biggest factor in compatibility with your hardware and system. HEVC(h265/x265) and AVC(h264/x264) are the main ones.","Bit depth- 8-bit/10-bit - Most high quality anime encodes are 10-bit. Converting an 8-bit source to 10-bit might seem counterintuitive if you know a little about transcoding and data loss, but it gives a better result at smaller sizes.","Frame rate- This will usually be 23.976 FPS. Many TVs use interpolation to turn this into 60 fps giving you an artificial sense of smoothness. This is not recommended for anime and should be disabled in settings. 60 FPS encodes are even worse and should be avoided.","Level/Profile- These are specifications within the h264/h265 standard which give an idea of compatibility and specify the maximum resolution and bitrate, for example h264 4.0 = 1080p 30fps 20 Mbps.

The best release for the purpose of this guide is an encode which fixes flaws of the raw bdmv while simultaneously not altering the original material too much. There is a difference between obvious flaws which need to be fixed and your subjective preference of how you like the encode. If something apparently looks \"better\" because it unnecessarily alters the video, then it's not a good indication of quality. These statements might seem too complicated or a bit vague, I'll try to explain in brief, but this is beyond the scope of a guide for beginners and more into the realm of encoding.","The official BDMV, from the blurays, is itself an encode of the actual source. It often suffers from issues like banding, blocking, noise, aliasing, etc. These might be originating from a variety of reasons. For example, a lot of anime is native 720p and is upscaled to 1080p for the bluray. Even if issues aren't present in the bdmv, they can appear in the encode because of compression.

You can directly upload/download from the seedbox to your computer by using a file transfer protocol (FTP) client (such as WinSCP, FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.). Since the seedbox is more likely to have a high upload speed compared to your internet connection as well as other peers in the swarm, it is more likely to be prioritized when seeding the bittorent packets. Typical advantages include:","Also make sure to create inbound/outbound rules for your torrent client on your firewall settings.","Alternatively, find your router manufacturer and model in this list for a concise, step-by-step guide for your exact router model.","Avoiding copyright/DMCA problems, especially if you are not using a VPN.","Being a non-connectable seeder will get you less upload next to a connectable seeder.","Being connectable means that you accept \"direct\" connections from seeders or leechers. In a rough metaphor, your \"address\" (IP) is known, and your \"door\" (port) is open to meet new peers.","Being non-connectable will still allow you to seed and leech, unless you are attempting to connect with another non-connectable peer.","Check out /r/seedboxes for more information. They are geared towards private trackers so be sure to check for public tracker support, as well as unlimited bandwidth with any seedbox provider.","Disable network rules such as flood protection, DDoS protection, traffic shaping, QOS etc. in your router settings. However, it is generally ill-advised due to security reasons.","Do not use port triggering - they are meant to be used for local network devices and those ports will be closed when they are not in use. Hence, they are not suitable for torrenting purpose.","Double check your torrent client configurations.","Flush your DNS cache by typing \"ipconfig /flushdns\" in the Windows command prompt. For Linux distributions, it varies from each other slightly as well as having many ways to do so. A quick Google search should help.","High uptime - a seedbox is on 24/7 seeding your torrents at high speed, that allows you to maintain a good ratio on private (and public) trackers.","If you are already port forwarding via a VPN, often times, it will show your port as closed. However, this is completely normal since those ports are ephemeral and only opened up when you are actively uploading/downloading something.","If you are somewhat tech-savvy, you can run your own virtual private server (VPS) or a dedicated server and use it as a virtual computer that can either be used as a seedbox, a VPN, or just about anything like your own personal computer. This is one of the more luxury options and tend to cost significantly more.","In case you have unknown issues preventing you from port forwarding despite correctly followed the instructions, try the following:","In the BitTorrent protocol, a transaction between 2 peers can only happen if at least one of them is connectable (one \"open door\" is enough).","Many seedboxes also support third-party plugins such as sonarr, plex etc.","Metamorphically, think of your torrent client like a laser pointer. When it runs, it tries to shoot a beam of light (the connection) to another person, but is blocked by a \"wall\" - which is your router. If your router does not have an appropriate \"hole\" (port) prepared, nobody from the other side will be able to see the beam of light.","Similarly, your torrent client also needs to run on a port on your device's private IP address. However, for anyone on the internet to be able to \"see\" your torrent client through this port, it has to be forwarded/connected to the equivalent port on your public IP address.","Sometimes port forwarding will fail if you're doing so through a proxy.","That said, you might be wondering on how to become connectable. This can be achieved relatively easily by port forwarding - which will be covered down below.","The easy way to do this is with UPnP - though it is considered a security risk by some, this is something enabled by default on both your router and in qBittorrent. It will automatically open the port needed by your torrent client without needing to manually change router settings. You can find and enable this on your torrent client and your router's settings (by logging into it).","The port used by your client can be found in Settings > Connection. Avoid using the well-known ports and the registered ports. To simplify - and preferably, use the ports from 49152 or higher to avoid interference with other services as well as being blocked by your ISP on some lower number ports.","This guide is not applicable to VPN users. If you are using one, please check with your VPN service provider and see if it allows port forwarding, as well as any instructions they might provide you with. If it does not, there is nothing you can do about it and it also has nothing to do with your router - either disable your VPN, or choose a different VPN service provider that allows port forwarding.","Use https://canyouseeme.org/ to check if this port is open. If it already is, you can skip this instruction. If you are already portforwarding via a VPN, often times, it will show your port as unopened. However, this is completely normal because those ports are ephemeral and only opened when you're actively uploading/downloading something.","Utilize a faster download/upload speed than your internet connection.","When you attempt to download something from a peer, you must first establish the connection with them. If their port is open, then you can directly connect with them and start downloading. If their port is not open, you must wait for them to connect with you.","While being connectible does not magically boost your upload speed, a properly configured setup increases the pool of potential peers to connect to. This will not make a difference with torrents that have hundreds of seeds, but can drastically increase upload speed on torrents with less seeds.","Your connection is assigned with a public \"address\" (IP address) by your ISP to your router. Your router will then assign a private (local) IP address to the devices that are connecting to it. On your devices, services which need to connect with another deivce over a network needs to have a \"door\" (port) opened (such as FTP on port 21, SSH & SFTP on port 22, HTTP on port 80, or HTTPS on port 443, etc.). The IP address and the port number combination (for example - http://192.168.0.1:8080/, where \"192.168.0.1\" is your private IP address, and \"8080\" is the port number) can be used to access the service in question."]},{"l":"Glossary","p":["Announcing: The act of registering yourself as a peer for a torrent on a tracker. The tracker will then return a list of peers on the torrent back to your torrent client.","Checksum/hash: A fixed-length value that is calculated based on all the data in the complete torrent that is intended to be unique to the specific torrent. Think of it like the torrent's unique ID. Used to identify the torrent to trackers and DHT.","DHT: Distributed hash table, the basis of trackerless torrents. Basically it is a giant table that, as the name implies, is distributed among all torrent clients. This table basically functions like a giant distributed tracker of all torrents that use DHT.","Hash checking: Verifying the integrity of the downloaded files using the file's hash.","Leech: A peer who is still downloading or someone who downloads more than they upload (slang).","Leeching: Downloading from other peers in the swarm.","Magnet link: a link containing at minimum the checksum of the torrent. May also contain the torrent name and/or one or more trackers. Since the magnet link does not contain torrent metadata, the .torrent file must be downloaded from the swarm first before the actual torrent can begin. Without any trackers, a magnet link requires DHT to find initial peers and begin downloading the .torrent file.","Peer: Any person who is uploading/downloading a torrent.","PEX: Peer exchange. This protocol allows peers on the same torrent to exchange lists of peers with each other. It is not as powerful as DHT because it cannot be used to join a new trackerless torrent; you have to know which peers to ask before you can ask.","Ratio: The number of bytes of data you have seeded to others divided by the number of bytes of data you have downloaded from others. If you download a 2GB movie, and you have seeded 1.5GB, your ratio on that torrent is 0.75 (1.5/2.0).","Seed: A peer who has finished downloading the torrent and is now uploading it to other peers.","Seeding: Uploading to other peers in the swarm.","Swarm: The entire set of peers.","Torrent file: A small file with a .torrent extension that you download to begin torrenting. Contains metadata about the torrent (checksum, list of files and their sizes, etc).","Tracker: A server that clients talk to to get lists of peers from the swarm.

For the video, I want to avoid hi10p and prefer hevc/x265 10-bit for potentially smaller sizes. And I want the superior video from a bluray, with fansubs, instead of a web release. For some reason, I also desire flac. So my search becomes","Konosuba BD 1080 hevc flac -hi10","Most releases are tagged both hevc and x265, explicitly mentioning only 265 like Konosuba BD 265 flac will also give you some results where the uploader forgot to tag hevc.

This helps a lot especially if you're an avid anime watcher and follow 10+ anime per season. Everything from auto-downloading new releases to selecting the \"correct\" resolution is automated.","How does the application decide which resolution to download?","I was recently informed that most anime is not actually produced in 1080p (I know, shocker!) but after looking into it I actually found a website that actually catalogs the native resolution of anime every season. That website is anibin. taiga2shana pulls information from that blog to inform its decision on the resolution of the follow. Essentially, it will default to 1080p unless anibin says it is 720p. Currently this behavior only works if you have Taiga, if you use the custom list method it just defaults to 1080p.","If you don't have Taiga:","If you have Taiga:","Note","Now you can just run taiga2shana.exe.
